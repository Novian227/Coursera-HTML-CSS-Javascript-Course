                <p>
                    A native app is the most widely used traditional way of making apps. Here you make different apps with different codebase to target different platforms.
                    General steps to make a native app.
                    Learn Java/Kotlin -> Download Android Studio -> Write code -> Build&Deploy
                    Learn Objective C/Swift -> Find a Mac for Xcode -> Write code -> Build&Deploy
                    Google develops and officially supports the Kotlin programming language, whereas Apple supports and develops the Swift programming language.

                    Previously known as PhoneGap, Apacheâ€™s Cordova is a mobile application development framework that embeds your HTML5 code inside a native WebView on the device. 
                    Cordova acts as a wrapper around HTML/JavaScript code and provides a bridge to access device hardware and functions of the device. These functions are exposed via a unified JavaScript API, allowing to easily write one set of code to target nearly many devices.

                <h2>PWA</h2>
                <p>
                    PWAs are hosted on a server and distributed using URLs instead of app stores. A PWA is found by the users using search engines.
                    They utilize a technology called Service Workers which allow the website to work offline. Service Workers allow to cache the website on the device and provide an icon for the bookmark created on the device.
                    Google has provided a checklist which lists down the criterion for a website to be called a PWA. Native device features supported by modern web browsers like camera, audio recording, video capture is the limit for such apps.
